  a -> 1 <br/>
  e -> 2 <br/>
  i -> 3 <br/>
  o -> 4 <br/>
  u -> 5;
  
* 10 - The `decode` function changes the numbers of a string for vowels according to this schema:
 
  1 -> a <br/>
  2 -> e <br/>
  3 -> i <br/>
  4 -> o <br/>
  5 -> u;
  
* 11 - The `techList` function receives an `array of strings (tecnologies)` and a `string (a person's name)` and returns an array of objects that associate the name of the person to the tecnologies:

```javascript
